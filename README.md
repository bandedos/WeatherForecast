# WeatherForecast

The goal of this exercise is to create a Weather Forecast application with Angular, which will test your understanding of the Angular framework.\
You will write some basic code, which will retrieve data from API and show 3 day weather forecast for a certain city.

The things that are expected:
- Http request to weatherapi (API key already included)
- Parsing the response into typescript model
- Presenting the data (text and image) in seperate component for each day
- Some basic UI improvements
